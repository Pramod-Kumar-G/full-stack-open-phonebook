# Phonebook (Part 3)

This folder contains the source code for the **Phonebook** app developed as part of Full Stack Open's Part 3 exercises.

> ⚠️ This folder is a **copy** of the main project hosted and deployed independently. It is **not** a standalone or actively deployed version of the app.

### 🌐 Live App
The live version of the app is hosted on [Render](https://render.com):

### 📁 Main GitHub Repository
The actual GitHub repository connected to the Render deployment is:

### ⚙️ Scripts (Note)

This copy is part of a larger monorepo (`full-stack-open`) and **does not support** some of the npm scripts that are available in the original repository:

- `npm run build:ui`
- `npm run deploy:full`

These scripts are defined and structured specifically for the main Phonebook repository and may not work correctly here.

### 📌 Purpose

This folder is here to maintain submission history for Full Stack Open exercises and showcase the solution in context. For actual development, deployment, or full features, please refer to the main repository linked above.
